This project aims to create a customizable GPT-powered assistant designed for university departments. The system allows users to set up a department-specific assistant by uploading files such as phone books, FAQs, and policies, as well as answering a brief questionnaire. The assistant operates exclusively on the provided resources, without web searches, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant responses.
